All tours are fully supported and travel from one beautiful 4 star inn to another. Each tour region is specially selected for historic value, eye candy, cycling terrain, and great lodging. 

Each tour is limited to 20 cyclists. This allows the group to become very close and spend a lot of time with their tour leader. The tours are geared for the amateur cyclist, with no daily ride over 60 miles.
